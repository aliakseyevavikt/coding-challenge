/*Exercise: Suppose a positive integer N is given. Determine the binary representation of N, and find the longest
subsequence of form 10*1 in this representation, where 0* stands for any number of zeros in the sequence.
Examples: 11, 101, 1001, 10001 etc. Return the number of zeros in the longest sequence you found.
If you didn't find such a sequence, return zero.
