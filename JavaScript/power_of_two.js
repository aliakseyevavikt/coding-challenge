/* TASK:
Complete the that determines if a given non-negative integer is a power of two.

!! a power of two is a number of the form 2 ** n where n is an integer

Examples
isPowerOfTwo(1024) // -> true
isPowerOfTwo(333)  // -> false
Beware of certain edge cases - for example, 1 is a power of 2 since 2^0 = 1 and 0 is not a power of 2.
